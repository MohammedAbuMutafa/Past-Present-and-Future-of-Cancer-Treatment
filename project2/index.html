            <h3 class="cancer1">WHAT IS CANCER</h3>
            <p>The National Cancer Institute (NIH) defines cancer as a disease where a person's cells
                start to multiply uncontrollably and rapidly and begin to spread to other parts
                of the body (“What Is Cancer?,” 2021). Cells sometimes multiply quickly, form tumors,
                and spread to other body parts through tissues. Mostly cancer is a genetic disease which means
                that changes in the genes control cell processes. But in the present day, we can see that
                cancer can also be a side effect of an unhealthy lifestyle. The name cancer comes from 
                “father of medicine” who found the differences between ulcer-forming tumors and
                non-ulcer-forming tumors (Understanding What Cancer Is: Ancient Times to Present, n.d.).</p>

            <h3 class="past">CANCER RESEARCH START</h3>
            <p>When cancer was first discovered, the ancients believed that it cannot be cured after the
                tumor spreads around the body. In addition, operating surgery to remove the tumor was very
                complex back then because of the high levels of blood loss. After anesthesia was discovered
                Physicians were more optimistic about cancer treatment. In the 19th century, William Stewart 
                Halsted, a professor from John Hopkins University, found a way to remove the cancer cells as 
                well as the affected lymphatic nodes. This process is called radical surgery. This was the only 
                progress cancer treatment had for four centuries. Radiation and other treatments were more 
                recent inventions for cancer treatment (Understanding What Cancer Is: Ancient Times to Present, n.d.).</p>

            </div>
            
            
            <h3 class="research">CURRENT RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>Cancer treatment saw more improvements and
                discoveries including chemotherapy and radiation. As of 2020, 18,094,716 million cases of cancer were diagnosed
                with 40% survival of risk factors (WCRF International, 2022). Cancer research is still ongoing and we have come a long way in terms of treatment.
                Although there is no proper cure for cancer, doctors have found ways to make cancer a less
                sufferable disease and bring ease to its victims. Chemotherapy and radiation are the most
                common procedures of cancer treatments along with radical surgery. Chemotherapy treats cancer
                by using drugs to kill the cancer cells in the body. Moreover, radiation uses x-rays to kill
                fast-growing cells that form tumors (“What Is Cancer?,” 2021). The evolution of cancer treatment has increased the number
                of cancer survivors and cleared the way for future advancements. A future improvement can be
                the establishment of immunomodulation, which treats cancer with the use of checkpoint
                blockade inhibitors on the immune system. Immunomodulation, with more research, has great
                potential to be a cure for cancer.</p>
