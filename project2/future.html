	<h1 class="title">Future of cancer treatment</h1>
	<p class="intro">As we think of the current utilizations of cancer treatments, it's also crucial to look at the future of cancer treatment as it is and will be prominent to many. 
		Having diverse and significant advances in the remedies for cancer is crucial in the practical and medical world.

	<h3 class="immunomodulation">Immunomodulation</h3>
	<div class="videoandpar1">
		<p class="par1">Different cancer treatments are getting established that are likely to work efficiently with current treatments like chemo and radiation therapy.
        				A great demonstration of this would be immunomodulation, which is the change in a body's immune system caused by activating or suppressing agents.
        				Danny Khalil and other dependable scientists and researchers created a review that tested patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC and used immunomodulation to attend to them.
        				They hypothesized that cancer is indirectly treated by acting on the immune system using checkpoint blockade inhibitors(Danny et al., 2016).

	<div class="videoandpar2">
    <p class="par2">Immunotherapy has been the most promising out of most of the impending cancer treatments; it has some hopeful advancements and is becoming recognized by many individuals who have decided
		 to further study the treatment. According to new research, the current immunotherapy approaches regarding cancer treatment are simple and barely cover the true potential of what could be done 
		as an aid to cancer cures there is still an immense amount of data that needs to be gathered about the complex environment that supports the tumor for further advancements
		(Murciano-Goroff et al., 2020). According to dependable sources, future improvements in immunomodulation could take place through the study of the categorization of tumors according to their 
		neoantigen presentation ability to see which immunotherapy combinations are most effective (Danny et al., 2016).
