            <p class="present-intro">In the modern era, the methods and technologies used to cure and treat cancer have immensely improved 
            from ancient times. Scientists have researched and developed better ways to medicate all types of cancer. 
            Modern cancer treatment procedures include chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery (Cancer Treatments, n.d.).</p>
            
            <h3 class="chemo-heading">Chemotherapy</h3>
            <p>Chemotherapy is a modern cancer treatment procedure that involves the usage of drugs to kill the affected cells 
            in the body. These drugs are either taken all at once or one after the other. Chemotherapy can be used as a 
            primary treatment and as a complementary treatment with surgery and radiation (Chemotherapy, 2022).</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3 class="rad-heading">Radiation</h3>
            <p>Radiation is a cancer treatment methodology that uses x-rays to kill cancer cells. Moreover, the tendency of radiation to 
            mostly kill fast-growing cells makes it effective because cancer cells divide faster than normal cells. 
            Radiation therapy has two types: external beam and internal beam. External beam points the x-rays at the 
            tumor from outside the body, on the other hand, internal beam delivers x-rays inside the body (Cancer Treatments, n.d.).</p>

                <p>(Majnun, n.d.)</p>
            </div>
            
            
            <h3 class="sur-heading">Surgery</h3>
            <p>Surgery has been utilized as a treatment for cancer since ancient times. Furthermore, due to the set of 
            refinements and advancements in surgery and the discovery of radical surgery, it is still a notable treatment 
            for cancer and has increased the chances of survival for cancer patients (John R. Heller, 1953).</p>

                <p>(Tipchai, n.d.)</p>
            </div>


            <p class="conclusion">Lastly, these improvements in modern cancer treatments helped optimize the chances of surviving this deadly disease and 
            paved the way for more developments in the future.</p>
