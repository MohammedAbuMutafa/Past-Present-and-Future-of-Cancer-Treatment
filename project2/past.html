            It is very important to undertand the past of cancer in order to see the progess we 
            have made. Cancer has been alive for centutries, hence we mst trace the first occurences
            of cancer to make conclusions and make treatments of the diease. cancer traces back to 
            3000 BC in ancient egypt and since then the world of cancer has drastically changed.

            <p class="past-text">
            When cancer was first discovered, the ancients believed that it cannot be cured after
            the tumor spreads around the body. In addition, operating surgery to remove the tumor
            was very complex back then because of the high levels of blood loss (History of cancer
            treatments, n.d.). Most physicians discovered that even if they removed the tumor 
            there were still chances that the cancer could come back again. Even if tumor removal
            saved the patient for some time, it was still a nearly impossible procedure to do at 
            that time because the equipment was not as developed. This belief lasted till the 19th 
            century.

            After anesthesia was discovered Physicians were more optimistic about cancer treatment.
            In the 19th century, William Stewart Halsted, a professor from John Hopkins University,
            found a way to remove the cancer cells as well as the affected lymphatic nodes 
            (which was, at that time, considered the reason cancer would reappear again after 
            removing the cells). He said that if cancer would ever return the same procedure would be used.
            This process is called radical surgery (History of cancer treatments, n.d.).
            This was the only progress cancer treatment had for 4 centuries. Radiation and other 
            treatments were more recent inventions for cancer treatment.
